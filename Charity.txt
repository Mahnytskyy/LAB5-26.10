"Charity begins at home".

It is said that charity begins at home, and people in the UK seem to have put these words into practice. Their enthusiasm for helping others shows in the 187,000 charity organisations that exist in the country.

 Some of the most famous ones are Oxfam, Age Concern, the RSPCA, the British Heart Foundation and Marie Curie Cancer Care.

People donate money to charity organisations or volunteer to help them raise money. Many of these organisations run charity shops. 

The first charity shop in the United Kingdom was established by Oxfam in Broad Street, Oxford. Oxfam has the largest number of charity shops in the UK with over 800 stores.
